# Autosense and Dynamic ISF/ICR
## Auto-sensitivity Mode
Auto-sensitivity reviews your last 8 hrs and 24 hrs of data and determines whether you have been reacting more or less sensitively to insulin. It then makes conservative temporary adjustments to your basal rates, blood sugar target, and ISF.


Example:
Autosens finds Bill has been running more sensitive to insulin lately. In the last 24 hours, he has been 2X more sensitive to insulin, whereas in the last 8 hours, he has been 3X more sensitive to insulin.

Autosens then takes the more conservative calculated sensitivity. In this example, the more conservative value is obtained from the 8 hour window because by assuming Bill is 3X more as opposed to 2X more sensitive to insulin the system will be posed to give less insulin.

Note that autosens does not look at meals and make adjustments to your ICR. It only looks at your sensitivity to insulin and adjust ISF/basal rates/blood sugar targets accordingly.
